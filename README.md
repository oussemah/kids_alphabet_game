This is a basic version of a Kids game to teach them letters.
The project consists of 2 parts :
 
 1- a part running on a linux pc  (with display and audio output capabilities): This is done using python.
 
 2- a part running on an STM32F4 that will translate custom keyboard strokes to keystrokes understood by linux pc
 
 You can use any type of "keyboard" as long as you map the keys inside the stm32 application
 STM32F4 and PC communicate via USB

 So far only PC part is done.
